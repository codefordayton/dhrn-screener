# DHRN Screener Tool

## About the Project

This is an attempt to build a screener tool for the DEC Dayton Home Repair Network program. We started trying to build this a Google form, but ran into significant limitations with the platform.

## Installation

This application is a small React application built with [Survey JS](https://surveyjs.io/). The application is built with npm and deployed automatically to Netlify, [here](https://astounding-moxie-dcf622.netlify.app/).

You can get started by running:

* `npm install` to install dependencies.
* `npm run dev` to run a local version.

To run dockerized version:

* `npm run build` to build the application
* `docker-compose up` to run using docker-compose

Pushes to the `main` branch are auto-deployed.

Ask me (Dave Best) if you'd like commit-bit on the repo. Otherwise, feel free to fork the repository and submit merge requests.
